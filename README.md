# Graph Generator


This program will generate graphs

Here is an example of a line of the data

> 0 1:4 2:4 3:1 4:4 5:4 6:2 7:1 8:1 9:4

The first number is the vertex label.

Each pair of numbers after that is an edge from that vertex. The number before the colon is the neighbor and the number after the colon is the edge weight.

It will output to stdout so use redirection to create any files you may need.

If you feel you can make it better, feel free to do so and do a pull request.
